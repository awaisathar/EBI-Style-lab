Cause and effect. We write text and create page layotus to make things happen, be it download a PDF, submit data or just think of EMBL-EBI as great place.

### When

Use this method on a series of web pages or ecosystem. This is primairly web-focused, but the methods can be adapted to print documents.

For example a service might have a few Core Content Specifications:

1. The homepage
  - A top layer model about how a user engages into the rest of the site.
2. An application side
  - How users submit a query, view results, download data, etc.
3. An "About" section
  - How users learn about the service, view news, engage with social media.

### Why

The Core Content Specification is a method we utilise to:

1. Make a statement of what we seek to achieve
2. Document the thinking and actors involved
3. Track success

### How

We have a tool to achieve this. A document template (more on that below) that asks the above three goals from different and interconected angles:

- Mission
- URLs
- Goals
- Target audience
- Content
- Inward and outward paths

#### Getting started

#### Get help

This is a fairly new and evolving process. We'd love to hear how you've utlised it, and we're happy to help you get started: [khawkins@ebi.ac.uk](mailto:khawkins@ebi.ac.uk)

##### A template
You can use the below Google Doc as template and documentation for your Core Content Specifications.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N8jU9EiRWHKN6h5PUpFmlWNA_pYN8e-5TAQBuD9UZ2Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="button external">Open the document in Google Docs</a>

### Future plans?

We've been using this model for the better part of a year with the Web Content Committee, so we have three parallel plans:

1. Visualise the data we've connected.
  - Core Content Specifications share interconnections, so we can view how the pathways between them and which ecosystems are performing.
2. Performance measurement
  - By looking at the documented content and associated goals, we can use tools like Google Analytics to measure more than time on page, and begin to measure real success.
3. A real database tool
  - Many parts of the Google Doc are a relational database and as such are a poor fit to be done by hand. We could build a better system on the web, once the model has fully stabilised (we should be nearly stable).
