### Meta tags

- Keywords: Think of these as tags that help to categorise the content of a page. Ten or 12 is probably a good maximum number to have.
- Description: Keep it brief - just describe what this page is about.


### Special EBI Content review tags
EMBL-EBI uses several special meta tags to help ensure content can owners can be updated, and that content is up to date.

```html
  <meta name="ebi:owner" content="John Doe"> <!-- Who should be contacted about changes -->
  <meta name="ebi:review-cycle" content="30"> <!-- In days, how often should the content be reviewed -->
  <meta name="ebi:last-review" content="2015-12-20"> <!-- The last time the content was reviewed -->
  <meta name="ebi:expiry" content="2016-01-20"> <!-- When this content is no longer relevant -->
```


### Local masthead image and colour tags
You can use thesse to specify colours or imagery you'd like for the local masthead. You could achieve a similar look through CSS, but this method offers more reusability and allows for planned future expansion, such as dynamic selection.

```html
<meta name="ebi:head-color" content="#091314">
<meta name="ebi:head-image" content="//ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Framework/images/backgrounds/embl-ebi-background-4.jpg">
```

<p><img src="https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Framework/images/backgrounds/training-yellow-4.jpg"></p>
To format your image, note the it will be alligned to the top-right of the local masthead, and you should account for wide screen displays; Here are some recommended specs:
- width: 2462px
- height: 322px

<div class="row"><div class="column">
{{> meta-copy}}
</div></div>
