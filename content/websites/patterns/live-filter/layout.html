If you have mutliple rows of data you'd like the use to be able to quickly sift through (perhaps combining with table sorting) we bundle the aptly named <a href="https://github.com/mikemerritt/LiveFilter">LiveFilter plugin</a>. It is not loaded by default and you'll need to load <code>LiveFilter/js/jquery.liveFilter.js</code>.

There are many such JS plugins available, but we found this one to work well and do just enough and <a href="https://github.com/mikemerritt/LiveFilter/pull/14/commits/6f6023d108d4b3a70157392f3231e245610dcc72">easily modldable to our needs</a>.

#### Bonus notes<
<ul>
  <li>The sample <code>input</code> has had <code>.clearable</code> added so a clear icon shows after text has been added by the user.</li>
  <li>We hint about the action that will be performed by placing a search icon to the left of the box, it does not however act as a button as the form is automatically updated on keypress.</li>
</ul>
